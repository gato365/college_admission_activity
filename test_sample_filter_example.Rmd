## What is a data frame?

### Everything is stored in a data frame
A <span style="color: red;">**data frame**</span> consists of rows and columns. 
 
 - the <span style="color: red;">**rows**</span> represent observations 
 - the <span style="color: red;">**columns**</span> represent the information collected on each observation. 
 
Click *Run Code* button to see an example of data frame that has some top artist from last year's billboard chart.


```{r viewdata, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
music_artist_df
```


### Quick Question 1

```{r longsong_Q1, echo = FALSE}
question("Which artist had the longest song based on the data frame? ",
         answer("Olivia Rodrigo", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The Weekend", message = "His song was the shortest"),
         answer("Dua Lipa", message = "Not Quite"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Title

### Long Songs
You do not like long songs, so you can <span style="color: blue;">**filter**</span> a data frame to obtain only songs that are strictly less than 4 minutes. The code below will only provide songs that are equal to or more than 4 minutes. 

Change the code so that you have a data frame that has songs strictly less than 4 minutes.

```{r filter_song1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(music_artist_df,Length >= 4)
```


### Quick Question 2

```{r filter_Q2, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the purpose of filter function? ",
         answer("Filter rows based on a condition", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Filter columns based on a condition", message = "What reduced: rows or columns"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```



## The Titles and Artists
Lets start off with the original music artist data frame. Lets say you want primarily focus on the Artist and Title columns, you can just <span style="color: blue;">**Select**</span> those columns. The code below only selects the Artist and Length.

Change the code so that you have a data frame that consists of the Artist and Title.

```{r select_column1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
select(music_artist_df,Artist, Length)
```


### Quick Question 3

```{r select_Q3, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the purpose of select function? ",
         answer("Selects columns", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Selects rows", message = "What reduced: rows or columns"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```


## Internship Opportunity

Based on your experience programming, your guidance counselor wants you to help your friends determine which schools to apply to. These friends happen to be triplets (Amber, Jake, and Olivia). However, they  do not know where they want to go. Their parents gave them the option of selecting schools in either Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, or Washington. Their parentâ€™s rationale is that the triplets know their relatives in these states. 

All siblings want to live on campus so that they can get the real college experience. You also know that they would like to be in a city because they always wanted to be near a lot of people. They know that they will not go to the same school because they have different criteria that are important to them. 

### Questions About the Scenario


### Quick Question 4

```{r descrip_Q4, echo = FALSE}

question_numeric(
  "How many states are they able to apply to based on their parents request?",
  answer(7, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  min = 7,
  max = 7,
  step = 0.01
)


```



```{r descrip_Q5, echo = FALSE}
question("What type of college campus does the triplets want to live in?",
         answer("City", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Suburban", message = "Read the second paragraph again"),
          answer("Rural", message = "Read the second paragraph again"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```




```{r descrip_Q6, echo = FALSE}
question("Do all siblings want to go to the same school? ",
         answer("No", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Yes", message = "Read the second paragraph again"),
         answer("It depends on where they get in",  message = "Read the second paragraph again"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Columns
Below represents a list of information collected on each school

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
data.frame(`Column_Names` = str_replace_all(colnames(city_college_df),'_',' ')) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

- **OOS** is Out-Of-State
- **IS** is In-State
- **LOC** is living on campus

## Amber's Preferences

Amber is only interested in the school name, ACT Composite, Out of state tuition. Amber also did better on her ACTs compared to her SATs so she only submitted her ACTs score where her composite score was a 32. 

Amber has a scholarship for playing tennis from Dwight F. Davis Memorial Scholarship where she does not have to worry about out of state tuition.

<!-- 1. Which columns do you think Amber should concentrate on based on her preferences? (Select All that apply) -->

Q. Create a data frame by selecting the columns that Are imperative to Amber's preference. Use an underscore, '_', rather than a space, ' '. Make sure to use correct spelling. 
```{r amber_pref_Q8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
amber_pref_df =  select(oos_city_college_df,1st_column_name,2nd_column_name,3rd_column_name)
```
We are saving this data frame as *amber_pref_df* to contain columns that only pertain to Amber's preferences.

                        Price_OOS_LOC)
```






<!-- 3. Action - **Filter**: Based on Amber's ACT score, filter out all the schools that would accept her based on her ACT score. -->
Q. Based on Amber's ACT score, create a data frame that only contains schools that has Amber's ACT score and lower. This means you must filter, so that out all the schools that would accept her based on her ACT score.

## Welcome

This is a demo tutorial. Compare it to the [source code](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/tree/main/inst/tutorials/ex-data-filter/ex-data-filter.Rmd) that made it.

###

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* use `filter()` to extract observations from a data frame or tibble
* write logical tests in R
* combine logical tests with Boolean operators
* handle missing values within logical tests

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2.

### Prerequisites

To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the nycflights13 package. This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is documented in `?flights`.

We will also use the ggplot2 package to visualize the data.

If you are ready to begin, click on!

## Filter rows with `filter()`

### filter()

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st. Click Run Code to give it a try:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


###  output

Like all dplyr functions, `filter()` returns a new data frame for you to save or use. It doesn't overwrite the old data frame.

If you want to save the output of `filter()`, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`.

Rerun the command in the code chunk below, but first arrange to save the output to an object named `jan1`.

```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r filter2-solution}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

###

Good job! You can now see the results by running the name jan1 by itself. Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input.

Did you notice that this code used the double equal operator, `==`? `==` is one of R's logical comparison operators. Comparison operators are key to using `filter()`, so let's take a look at them.

## Logical Comparisons

### Comparison operators

R provides a suite of comparison operators that you can use to compare values: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). Each creates a logical test. For example, is `pi` greater than three?

```{r}
pi > 3
```

###

When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ whose day value was equal to one.

### Watch out!

When you start out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

### Multiple tests

If you give `filter()` more than one logical test, `filter()` will combine the tests with an implied "and." In other words, `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every test. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators...

## Boolean operators

### &, |, and !

R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (_and_), `|` (_or_), `!` (_not_ or _negation_), and `xor()` (_exactly or_).

Both `|` and `xor()` will return TRUE if one or the other logical comparison returns TRUE. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return FALSE if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exactly or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each command selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write out a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

###

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```

###

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

###

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values should evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
NA == NA
```

```{r nas-check}
"In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`."
```

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r}
NA == NA
```

It's easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA
# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA
# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

### filter() and NAs

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that

1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

<!-- ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r filterex1-solution}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120) # arr_delay is in minutes
```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

<!-- ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex2-solution}
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
```

<div id="filterex2-hint">
**Hint:** This is a good case for the `%in%` operator.
</div>

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)

<!-- ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex3-solution}
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
```

<div id="filterex3-hint">
**Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
</div>

1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

<!-- ```{r filterex4, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex4-solution}
filter(flights, 6 < month, month < 10)
```

<div id="filterex4-hint">
**Hint:** When converted to numbers, July, August, and September become 7, 8, and 9.
</div>

1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

<!-- ```{r filterex5, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex5-solution}
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
```

<div id="filterex5-hint">
**Hint:** Remember that departure and arrival delays are recorded in     _minutes_.
</div>

1. Were delayed more than an hour, but made up more than 30 minutes in flight

<!-- ```{r filterex6, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex6-solution}
filter(flights, dep_delay > 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay) > 30)
```

<div id="filterex6-hint">
**Hint:** The time a plane makes up is `dep_delay - arr_delay`.
</div>

1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

<!-- ```{r filterex7, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex7-solution}
filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400)
```

<div id="filterex7-hint">
**Hint:** Don't forget flights that left at exactly midnight (`2400`). This is a good case for an "or" operator.
</div>

### Exercise 2

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use `between()` to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r filterex8, exercise = TRUE}
?between
```

### Exercise 3

How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

<!-- ```{r filterex9, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r filterex9-solution}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

<div id="filterex9-hint">
**Hint:** This is a good case for `is.na()`.
</div>

```{r filterex9-check}
"Flights with a missing departure time are probably cancelled flights."
```

### Exercise 4

Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing?
Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general
rule?  (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)

<!-- ```{r filterex10, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->
```{r filterex10-hint-1}
# any number with a zero exponent is equal to one
NA ^ 0
```

```{r filterex10-hint-2}
# unknown value or true evaluates to true
# (because if one operand of "or" is true, we can be sure the result is true)
NA | TRUE
```

```{r filterex10-hint-3}
# false and unknown value evaluates to false
# (because if one operand of "and" is true, we can be sure the result is false)
FALSE & NA
```

```{r filterex10-hint-4}
# this is not a logical comparison, it's a numerical calculation involving an
# unknown value, thus resulting in an unknown value
NA * 0
```
